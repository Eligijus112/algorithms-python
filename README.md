# Algorithms and data structures

Examples of various popular data structures and algorithms in Python. 

# Algorithms 

All the algorithms are in the `algorithms directory`. 

Experimentations and showcasing of the algorithms are added in the `algorithms/notebooks` directory,

## Bubble sort 

The class that implements the bubble sort algorithm is in the `algorithms/BubbleSort/BubbleSort.py` file.

## Selection sort 

The class that implements the selection sort algorithm is in the `algorithms/SelectionSort/SelectionSort.py` file.

## Insertion sort 

The class that implements the insertion sort algorithm is in the `algorithms/InsertionSort/InsertionSort.py` file.

## Merge sort

The class that implements the merge sort algorithm is in the `alogirthms/MergeSort/MergeSort.py` file.

# Tests 

All the tests are in the `tests` directory.

To test out if the algorithms are working correctly, run the command:

```
pytest
```
